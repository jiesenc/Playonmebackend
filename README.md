# Playonmebackend
Playonme is a smart tennis training application that empowers recreational and beginner-level tennis players to improve their technique through AI-driven video analysis. By combining motion capture, pose estimation, and biomechanical comparison with professional-level benchmarks, the app delivers personalized insights that help players identify flaws and enhance their performance—all from their mobile device or web browser.

🎯 Key Features
📹 Video Upload & Playback – Upload your tennis stroke video and watch it frame-by-frame with overlayed posture shadows for comparison.

🎾 AI-Powered Stroke Scoring – Uses pose estimation and body-angle analysis (via MediaPipe and NumPy) to generate a performance score.

🧍‍♂️ Pose Shadow Overlay – Visualizes a "ghost" of the correct form directly on top of your own movement for intuitive feedback.

📊 Historical Feedback & Scores – Track your progress across multiple videos and sessions over time.

🔁 Pro Player Matching (Optional) – Compares your posture to top 100 ATP/WTA players and shows similarity match (optional due to potential licensing concerns).

🧠 Expandable Model Versions – Swap out pose analysis logic or models to test improvements.

🧰 Tech Stack
Frontend: Flutter (via Bolt/Expo React Native components), TypeScript, React Native

Backend: Python (Flask), MediaPipe, NumPy, OpenCV
